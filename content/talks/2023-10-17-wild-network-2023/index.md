### Abstract

The world is collecting more data than ever before, and there are many ways that it can be used in healthcare and medicine to improve our health and wellbeing. Data can help us to understand what happens to our brains as we get older, provide more information for doctors diagnosing rare heart murmurs, or identify ways to make the NHS more efficient. This talk will showcase some of the research we’re currently doing within Lancaster Medical School to make better use of data and technology within medicine.

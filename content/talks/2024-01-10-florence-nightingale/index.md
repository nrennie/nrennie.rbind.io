## Data, technology and medicine: Using data science to improve health outcomes

The world is collecting more data than ever before, and there are many ways that it can be used in healthcare and medicine to improve our health and wellbeing. Data can help us to understand what happens to our brains as we get older, provide more information for doctors diagnosing rare heart murmurs, or identify ways to make the NHS more efficient. In this talk, I'll discuss some of the research projects I've had the privilege to contribute to and showcase some of the ways we can make better use of data and technology within medicine. I'm also looking forward to sharing the process of working on these projects, and the journey I’ve taken to working in data science.

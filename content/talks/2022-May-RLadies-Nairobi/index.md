During April 2022, I participated in the #30DayChartChallenge - a data visualisation challenge where participants create a new chart each day based on the daily prompt. In this talk, I'll discuss why and how I created 30 charts, the aspects I found most challenging, and some interesting things I discovered in R along the way!

The code for all plots created during the challenge is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nrennie/30DayChartChallenge). I also recently wrote a [blog post](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/2022-05-07-30-day-chart-challenge-2022/) about the experience, which relates closely to the content in this talk.

The code used to generate the slides is also available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/nrennie/R-Ladies/tree/main/RLadiesNairobi/2022-05-26).

Thank you very much to [R-Ladies Nairobi](https://twitter.com/RLadiesNairobi) for the invite, and to [Njoki Njuki](https://twitter.com/lucy_njokinjuki) for organising.

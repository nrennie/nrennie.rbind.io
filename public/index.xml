      <description>OverviewThe tiles() series is loosely inspired by mosaic tiling techniques. Each generative artwork consists of a grid of tiles, where each tile is made up of three squares - one large, one medium, and one small. The colouring algorithm ensures that the three squares on each tile are of different colours.
The colour palettes for this series comes from the {MetBrewer} package written by Blake Robert Mills (@BlakeRobMills.</description>

      <description>OverviewAvailable in two colour schemes, the vortex() series is inspired by patterns observed in fluid dynamics. This artwork is generated using line graphs and polar coordinates. There are two custom colour palettes available for this artwork - either a monochrome, or rainbow effect.
InstallationThis generative artwork can be reproduced using my {aRt} package on GitHub, which you can install in R using:
remotes::install_github(&amp;quot;nrennie/aRt&amp;quot;)library(aRt)vortex()Packages required {ggplot2}  Parameters n specifies how many lines are drawn i.</description>

      <description>One of my goals for 2021 was to participate in the #TidyTuesday challenge on a regular basis. This blog post reflects on the past year of data visualisations.
For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, #TidyTuesday is a weekly data challenge aimed at the R community. Every week a new dataset is posted alongside a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask participants explore the data. You can access the data and find out more here.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week, whilst curating for @WeAreRLadies, I tweeted a thread on my thought process for this week&amp;rsquo;s #TidyTuesday challenge. This blog post expands on the thoughts in this aforementioned thread:
It can be a little bit scary to make your first (or any) contribution to #TidyTuesday on twitter so I thought I’d outline my thought process for this week’s Spice Girls data. pic.twitter.com/zsyV3mfRkG

      <description>The #30DayMapChallenge is a daily mapping, cartography, and data visualization challenge aimed at the spatial community. Every day in November participants create a map with a given theme (e.g. population, monochrome, raster) and share their results Twitter using the #30DayMapChallenge hashtag. Check out the challenge here.
Although I&amp;rsquo;ve been creating data visualisations for a while, I don&amp;rsquo;t normally have that many opportunities to work with spatial data. This year, I created all 30 maps (see below).</description>

      <description>I recently completed my PhD at STOR-i CDT at Lancaster University. My thesis was titled &amp;ldquo;Detecting demand outliers in transport systems&amp;rdquo; and here I&amp;rsquo;ll (try to) give a brief overview of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the last three years. The final version of my thesis can be found here.
Super happy to announce that this morning I passed my PhD viva with no corrections. 🎉🎉Thank you to my examiners Dr.</description>

      <description>At the same time as pension ages in the UK continue to rise, both academics and journalists claim that life expectancy is stalling. To investigate these claims, we look at changes in UK life expectancy growth from 1960 to present day. Using data from World Bank Open Data, we use a rolling window linear model to estimate how life expectancy has changed decade-by-decade. We find that though there has been a steep decline in life expectancy growth in the last ten years, the growth is still positive and life expectancy continues to increase.</description>

      <title>Detecting outlying demand in multi-leg bookings for transportation networks</title>
      <link>https://nrennie.rbind.io/talks/2021-july-euro2021/</link>

      <description>Network effects complicate transport demand forecasting in general and outlier detection in particular. For example, a sudden increase in demand for a specific destination will not only affect the legs arriving at that destination, but also connected legs nearby in the network. Network effects are particularly strong when service providers, such as railway or coach companies, offer many multi-leg itineraries. In such situations, automated alerts can help analysts to adjust demand forecasts and enable reliable planning.</description>

      <description>In June, the #CottonViz data visualisation challenge was run by the History of Statistics &amp;amp; Young Statisticians sections of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS). The challenge aimed to celebrate the work of Mary Eleanor Spear (1897 –1986), credited with popularising the range-bar charts.
Reimagining Mary Eleanor Spear&amp;#39;s visualisation of US cotton supply for the #CotttonViz competition with @HistoryofStats and @statsyss. First time using the {ggpattern} package (great for colourblind-friendly visualisations).#DataVisualization #DataViz #RStats pic.</description>

      <title>Detecting outlier demand in revenue management networks</title>

      <description>Transport service providers, such as airlines or railways, often use revenue management systems to control ticket prices and availability. Such systems rely on accurately forecasting expected demand to prepare optimal capacity allocations. Extraordinary events generate outlier demand, and cause inaccurate forecasts resulting in non-optimal allocations. Most revenue management systems allow room for analysts to compare the accumulated bookings against the forecasts and to intervene, if they deem the demand forecast to be inaccurate.</description>

      <description>Transport service providers, such as airlines and railways, often use revenue manage-ment to control offers and demand in mobility networks. Such systems rely on accu-rate demand forecasts as input for the underlying optimisation models. When changes in the market place cause demand to deviate from the expected values, revenue man-agement controls no longer fit for the resulting outliers. Analysts can intervene if they deem the demand forecast to be inaccurate. However, existing research on judgemen-tal forecasting highlights fallibility and bias when human decision makers are not sys-tematically supported in such tasks.</description>

      <title>Identifying and responding to outlier demand in revenue management</title>

      <description>Revenue management strongly relies on accurate forecasts. Thus, when extraordinary events cause outlier demand, revenue management systems need to recognise this and adapt both forecast and controls. State-of-the-art systems rely on analyst expertise to identify outlier demand both online (within the booking horizon) and offline (in hindsight). In light of the partial nature of revenue management data and censoring effects from inventory controls, so far, there exists little research on automating the detection of outlier demand.</description>

      <description>Most quantity-based airline revenue management systems rely on forecasting expected demand to prepare revenue-optimal capacity allocations. Inaccurate demand forecasts result in non-optimal allocations and hence, hurt revenue. Most airline revenue management systems also allow room for analysts to compare the accumulated bookings against the forecasts and to intervene, if they deem the demand forecast to be inaccurate.
